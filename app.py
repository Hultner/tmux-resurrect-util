"""tmux-res – TMUX Resurrect utility tool

I have not tested this yet but an idea I've had is to run the clean command as
a weekly cronjob, that way we can keep our resurrect-directory clean and tidy
without manual intervention. Maybe also run link-last on boot (recover crash)

This is currently in a working state for me but I have some future improvements
which I've considered. Listing them below.

TODO:
    - [x] Recover `last` link to latest state
    - [x] Archive resurrect files older then given treshold (clean up)
    - [x] Publish to Github
    - [ ] Write tests (pytest+hypothesis)
    - [ ] Travis CI/CD
    - [ ] Codacy code quality, coverage
    - [ ] Move helpers/utils to sperate files
    - [ ] Move TmuxResFile class to file?
    - [ ] Improve docstrings
    - [ ] Lint and refactor
    - [ ] See if there's a better way to handle `verbose()` function
    - [ ] Publish to PyPa/pip
    - [ ] Investigate if asyncio can give any benefit, parseing res files
    - [ ] Investigate globals replacement (especially for async)
    - [ ] Pass ENV/constanst through args via click.option envvar
        http://click.pocoo.org/5/options/#values-from-environment-variables
        http://click.pocoo.org/5/options/#multiple-values-from-environment-values
        - [ ] RESURRECT_PATH = "~/.tmux/resurrect"
        - [ ] ARCHIVE_DAYS_THRESHOLD = 7 || 30
        - [ ] ARCHIVE_FILES_THRESHOLD = 10
    - [ ] Create a wrapper class for List[TmuxResFile]
        - [ ] Balanced/sorted insert
            https://github.com/grantjenks/python-sortedcontainers/
        - [ ] Get most recent state
        - [ ] Get oldest state
        - [ ] Get all states in time frame (start=None, end=None), None=unbound
            - [ ] Returns instance of wrapper class with subset
        - [ ] Refresh/update state (can be done after archive)
        - [ ] Get List[pathlib.Path]-collection
    - [ ] Improve typeannotatins, test with mypy
    - [ ] Generate sphinx docs
    - [ ] Add pycov-coverage reporting
    - [ ] Archive files atomically/safer, eg. if someone for some reason runs
        multiple instances of tmux-res simantainously (bad)
        I don't know if people actually ever access old state files, my initial
        idea was to delete them completely but since they're quite small I
        decided on archiving.
        - [ ] Maybe copy files first, use random UUID/tmp for archive directory
            then remove them once archive is done and working



Warning: This module uses several features introduced in 3.7 and 3.6.
    I've built this tool purely for personaly usage. I use it as a oppertunity
    to try out new features which makes development more convenient.

    Feel free to backport if you want to use it with older versions, to simplify
    this process I've listed new features from 3.7 I know that I use.

Python 3.7 features:
    Forward annotation references
    - Quote or remove for backwards compability
    Dataclasses
    - Install package on 3.6, expand for older
    datetime.fromisoformat
    - Define format manually or use library for older versions
